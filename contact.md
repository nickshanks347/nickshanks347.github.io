* Best way to contact me is via email at: [nick.shanks99@gmail.com](mailto:nick.shanks99@gmail.com) or [nick@tfsi.dev](mailto:nick@tfsi.dev)
* I check the second email more often. 
* I currently host a password-protected Wordpress instance, Virtualmin, Privatebin, ZNC bouncer and a Modoboa mail server on another instance. If you would like an email, a ZNC bouncer or a subdomain then let me know at one of the emails above. You can see my root domain at [tfsi.dev](https://tfsi.dev).
